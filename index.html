    <h3>📜 A little letter for you</h3>
    


<p>Dear Selam,</p>

<p>Today is your birthday, It’s the day the world gently gained a little more beauty. And even though I can’t be there with you right now, my heart is very much with you. I’ve been thinking about this day for a while....about what I’d want you to feel when you read these words.</p>

<p>You are someone who came into my life quietly, but stayed loudly in my heart. The way you speak, the way you care, the way you understand... all of it matters more to me than you probably realize. You have a presence that brings calm, even from a distance.</p>

<p>Sometimes I catch myself smiling at my phone after our conversations. Sometimes I replay your words in my head without meaning to. And sometimes I just feel grateful, grateful that out of all the people in the world, I get to know you.</p>

<p>What I admire most about you is not just what everyone can see, but what only someone close can feel. Your kindness. Your patience. The softness of your heart. The strength you carry without showing off. You make the world around you better just by being in it. There’s something special about the way you exist in my life. You don’t try too hard, you don’t pretend... you’re just you, and somehow that’s more than enough. Being around you, talking to you even through text or phonecall, feels good, It feels honest, It feels real.</p>

<p>On days when things feel heavy and quiet, talking to you, being with you or just thinking of you brings a sense of warmth I can’t really explain. You have this way of making moments feel lighter, reminding me that good things still exist. That kind of presence is rare, and I don’t take it for granted.<p/>

<p>Even though today we’re apart, I hope you still feel celebrated. I hope you feel loved, appreciated, and deeply valued. Because you deserve that not just on your birthday, but every day.</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly what the future holds but I know this, I’m thankful for you. For every conversation, every laugh, every moment we’ve shared. And I’m looking forward to creating many more memories with you.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday my love 🤍</p>
<p>May this year bring you peace, growth, and happiness. I hope you always remember how special you are.</p>
<p>I love you <p/>

    <h3>🤍 A promise</h3>
    <p>I promise to keep choosing you.<br>
To be honest with you.<br>
To respect you, support you, and celebrate you. Not just today, but always.</p>

<p>No matter where life takes us, I’ll always be grateful that our paths crossed.</p>
